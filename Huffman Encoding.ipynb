Huffman encoding, a pivotal algorithm in data compression, operates by assigning variable-length binary codes to characters based on their frequencies within the input data. Initially, the algorithm scans the input to compute the occurrence frequency of each character, aiming to allocate shorter codes to more frequently appearing characters. Subsequently, a Huffman tree is constructed, where each leaf node denotes a character along with its frequency, and non-leaf nodes represent cumulative frequencies. Throughout tree construction, the algorithm systematically merges nodes with the lowest frequencies until a single root node forms. Following tree creation, Huffman codes are assigned by traversing the tree, associating '0' with left branches and '1' with right branches. The resulting Huffman codes encode the original data more efficiently, with shorter codes representing more common characters and longer codes assigned to less frequent ones.\n","\n","One of the key benefits of Huffman encoding lies in its ability to achieve near-optimal compression rates, effectively reducing the size of data while maintaining lossless integrity. The algorithm's adaptability to the statistical characteristics of the input data enables it to generate highly efficient encodings, particularly for data with non-uniform distributions. Moreover, Huffman encoding serves as the foundation for numerous compression techniques and is widely employed in various domains, including file compression utilities, network protocols, and multimedia compression algorithms. Its elegant simplicity and effectiveness have cemented its status as a fundamental tool in data compression, driving advancements in efficient data storage, transmission, and processing across diverse technological landscapes."],"metadata":{"id":"xUuz-PrmnFlZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","class Node:\n","    def __init__(self, char, freq):\n","        self.char = char\n","        self.freq = freq\n","        self.left = None\n","        self.right = None\n","\n","def build_huffman_tree(text):\n","    # Count the frequency of each character in the text\n","    freq_counter = {}\n","    for char in text:\n","        if char in freq_counter:\n","            freq_counter[char] += 1\n","        else:\n","            freq_counter[char] = 1\n","    print(freq_counter)\n","    # Create a list of nodes\n","    nodes = [Node(char, freq) for char, freq in freq_counter.items()]\n","\n","\n","    while len(nodes) > 1:\n","        # Sort the nodes by frequency\n","        nodes.sort(key=lambda x: x.freq)\n","\n","        # Take the two nodes with the lowest frequency\n","        left = nodes.pop(0)\n","        right = nodes.pop(0)\n","\n","        # Create a new node with the combined frequency\n","        merged = Node(None, left.freq + right.freq)\n","        merged.left = left\n","        merged.right = right\n","\n","        # Append the new node to the list\n","        nodes.append(merged)\n","\n","    # Return the root node of the Huffman tree\n","    return nodes[0]\n","\n","def encode_huffman_tree(root, encoding_table, current_encoding=\"\"):\n","    if root is not None:\n","        if root.char is not None:\n","            encoding_table[root.char] = current_encoding\n","        encode_huffman_tree(root.left, encoding_table, current_encoding + \"0\")\n","        encode_huffman_tree(root.right, encoding_table, current_encoding + \"1\")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"5n1Ds0JX2p7X","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1706777808032,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Nidhi S","userId":"11969419468384628628"}}},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Encoding\n","def huffman_encoding(text):\n","    if len(text) == 0:\n","        return \"\", None\n","\n","    root = build_huffman_tree(text)\n","    encoding_table = {}\n","    encode_huffman_tree(root, encoding_table)\n","\n","    # Encode the text\n","    encoded_text = ''.join(encoding_table[char] for char in text)\n","\n","    return encoded_text, root"],"metadata":{"id":"x9aTsHdo26CL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1706777810477,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Nidhi S","userId":"11969419468384628628"}}},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def huffman_decoding(encoded_text, root):\n","    decoded_text = \"\"\n","    current_node = root\n","\n","    for bit in encoded_text:\n","        if bit == \"0\":\n","            current_node = current_node.left\n","        else:\n","            current_node = current_node.right\n","\n","        if current_node.char is not None:\n","            decoded_text += current_node.char\n","            current_node = root\n","\n","    return decoded_text"],"metadata":{"id":"8I2U3NXZ3kI9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1706777812054,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Nidhi S","userId":"11969419468384628628"}}},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","\n","    text = input(\"Enter a word:\")\n","\n","    # Encoding\n","    encoded_text, huffman_tree = huffman_encoding(text)\n","    print(\"Encoded text:\", encoded_text)\n","\n","    # Decoding\n","    decoded_text = huffman_decoding(encoded_text, huffman_tree)\n","    print(\"Decoded text:\", decoded_text)"],"metadata":{"id":"atbx_bHb3tyy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1706777817916,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3892,"user":{"displayName":"Nidhi S","userId":"11969419468384628628"}},"outputId":"3d68e60a-1cb2-474b-e430-e58eb0ae103c","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter a word:AABBC\n","{'A': 2, 'B': 2, 'C': 1}\n","Encoded text: 11110010\n","Decoded text: AABBC\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"xt5mOTPO4p6u"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
