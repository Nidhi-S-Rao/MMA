Unlike Huffman encoding, which assigns fixed-length codes to individual symbols, arithmetic encoding uses a single code for the entire sequence. This method operates by dividing the interval [0, 1) into sub-intervals, each corresponding to a unique symbol in the input sequence. During encoding, the algorithm progressively narrows down the interval to represent the entire sequence, assigning a unique sub-interval to each symbol based on its probability of occurrence. As the process continues, the resulting fraction lies within a smaller and smaller subrange, providing a highly compact representation of the original data.\n","\n","Arithmetic encoding's flexibility allows for the compression of data with unequal symbol frequencies more efficiently than Huffman encoding. However, its decoding process is more complex and requires precise arithmetic operations. During decoding, the original sequence is reconstructed by reverse mapping the fractional number back to the corresponding sequence of symbols. Despite its computational demands, arithmetic encoding offers superior compression ratios, making it a preferred choice in scenarios where data compression efficiency is paramount, such as image and video compression standards like JPEG and MPEG. Its ability to accurately model symbol probabilities and its suitability for adaptive coding schemes contribute to its widespread adoption in various compression applications, playing a crucial role in modern data compression techniques and algorithms."],"metadata":{"id":"tmloUjL303Tk"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"XQ0oyJpP0zkZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1706778494816,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":12235,"user":{"displayName":"Nidhi S","userId":"11969419468384628628"}},"outputId":"22df7f7e-6bf2-42e8-e42f-1ab8a2a0063e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter the text to encode: AABBAC\n","Enter the probability for symbol A: 0.5\n","Enter the probability for symbol B: 0.25\n","Enter the probability for symbol C: 0.25\n","Encoded code: 0.1630859375\n","Decoded text: AABBAC\n"]}],"source":["\n","class ArithmeticEncoder:\n","    def __init__(self, precision=32):\n","        self.precision = precision\n","\n","    def encode(self, text, probabilities):\n","        low = 0.0\n","        high = 1.0\n","        prob_range = 1.0\n","\n","        for symbol in text:\n","\n","            high = low + prob_range * probabilities[symbol][1]\n","            low = low + prob_range * probabilities[symbol][0]\n","            prob_range = high - low\n","\n","        code = (low + high) / 2\n","        return code\n","\n","    def decode(self, encoded_code, probabilities, text_length):\n","        decoded_text = \"\"\n","        code = encoded_code\n","        for _ in range(text_length):\n","            for symbol, (low_range, high_range) in probabilities.items():\n","                if low_range <= code < high_range:\n","                    decoded_text += symbol\n","                    code = (code - low_range) / (high_range - low_range)\n","                    break\n","        return decoded_text\n","\n","\n","\n","if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","    text = input(\"Enter the text to encode: \")\n","    probabilities = {}\n","    cumulative_prob = 0.0\n","    for symbol in set(text):\n","        prob_input = float(input(f\"Enter the probability for symbol {symbol}: \"))\n","        probabilities[symbol] = (cumulative_prob, cumulative_prob + prob_input)\n","        cumulative_prob += prob_input\n","    #Encoding\n","    encoder = ArithmeticEncoder()\n","    encoded_code = encoder.encode(text, probabilities)\n","    print(\"Encoded code:\", encoded_code)\n","\n","    # Decoding\n","    text_length = len(text)\n","    decoded_text = encoder.decode(encoded_code, probabilities, text_length)\n","    print(\"Decoded text:\", decoded_text)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"IC4QhY1u0-lK"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
