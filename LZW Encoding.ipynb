During encoding, LZW scans the input data sequentially, constructing and updating the dictionary dynamically as it encounters new substrings. It efficiently replaces repeated substrings with shorter codes, reducing the overall size of the encoded data. LZW begins with an initial dictionary containing single-character entries, typically ASCII characters, and assigns each character a unique index. As the algorithm processes the input data, it gradually adds new substrings to the dictionary, associating them with unused dictionary indices. This adaptive nature enables LZW to adapt to the input data's patterns and generate more compact representations.\n","\n","Throughout the encoding process, LZW employs a sliding window approach to identify and compress repeated substrings efficiently. It encodes the input data by replacing sequences of characters with their corresponding dictionary indices, effectively reducing redundancy and achieving compression. LZW's simplicity, effectiveness, and adaptability have made it a popular choice for various applications, including image formats like GIF and file compression utilities such as ZIP. However, while LZW encoding provides significant compression gains for certain types of data, it may struggle with highly randomized or already compressed data, where patterns are less prevalent, leading to diminished compression ratios. Nonetheless, its widespread adoption underscores its importance in the landscape of data compression algorithms."],"metadata":{"id":"Pe-Wd-It1Qxt"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Encoding\n","def lzw_algorithm(input_text, custom_codes):\n","    dictionary = {}\n","    code = 1\n","\n","    #
